In the given flow diagram, the interaction between ChatGPT, Node.js, and GridDB is illustrated, showcasing the overall system workflow for multi-news data acquisition, processing, and content tagging. The diagram can be broken down into the following steps for a better understanding:

1. Data Acquisition: Node.js is employed to collect and acquire data from multiple news sources.

2. Data Processing: Once the data is obtained, Node.js is responsible for processing and filtering the relevant information, ensuring that it is in the desired format for further use.

3. Data Storage: After processing, the refined data is stored in GridDB, a high-performance, scalable NoSQL database, which provides efficient storage and retrieval of the data.

4. Content Tagging with ChatGPT: The processed data is then fed to ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art AI language model. ChatGPT analyzes the data and generates content tags based on the context and relevant keywords.

5. Saving Tags to GridDB: The content tags generated by ChatGPT are subsequently saved back into GridDB, which allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and organization of the tagged content.

6. Presenting the Data to the User with React: After the data has been processed, stored, and tagged, it is important to present it in an accessible and user-friendly format. In this case, React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is utilized to create a web-based application that displays news and the tagged content in an organized manner.

In summary, the updated flow diagram represents a system that employs Node.js for data acquisition and processing, GridDB for data storage, ChatGPT for content tagging, and React for creating a user-friendly interface that presents the data to end-users, resulting in a comprehensive and efficient multi-news data handling solution.

## Key Concepts and Practical Codes

### Using ChatGPT to Generate News Tags

ChatGPT is an advanced artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. The model is designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It is capable of performing various tasks, including answering questions, engaging in conversation, and generating text in a range of styles and formats. ChatGPT has been widely used in various applications, such as chatbots, content generation, translation, and more.

As the core natural language processing component, ChatGPT is responsible for analyzing and generating tags from news articles. By leveraging its advanced language understanding capabilities, ChatGPT can identify and group related articles based on their underlying themes, significantly enhancing content organization and discovery.

#### Prompt

As ChatGPT is capable of natural language understanding, generating tags from a news article is ridiculously easy. All we have to do is ask for it!

A prompt is text used to guide a language model or machine learning system to generate a relevant output. It can take many forms, such as questions, commands, or passages of text, and a well-designed prompt is crucial for accuracy and relevance of the output.

To generate tags from a news article, we can provide a prompt to ChatGPT that specifies the desired output. For example, in JavaScript the prompt could be structured like this:

```js
const prompt = `Generate five tags from this news with each tag is less than 2 words:\n\n${news}`;
```

If we apply that prompt directly into the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) website with a specific `news` we will get 5 tags.

![generate-tag-chatgpt](/assets/images/tag-generate-chatgpt.png)

OpenAI provide [Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for user to access ChatGPT models. We will use `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to generate tags from our news.

```js
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function generateTagsFromNews(news) {
  const prompt = `Generate five tags from this news with each tag is less than 2 words:\n\n${news}`;
  try {
    const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    });
    return completion.data.choices[0].message;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error occurred while generating tags:", error);
    // Handle the error as needed, or return a suitable error message
    return "An error occurred while generating tags.";
  }
}

export { generateTagsFromNews };
```

To access the OpenAI API, you'll need to obtain an `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be obtained from this [link](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Note that you'll need to set up a paid account in order to use the API, but the cost is quite low at just $0.002 per 1,000 tokens. A rough estimate is that 1,000 tokens corresponds to around 200 to 300 words in English, based on the average word length of 4-5 characters plus a space (totaling 5-6 characters per word).

### Data Acquisition and Processing with Node.js

Node.js serves as the backbone of the web application, allowing developers to build a fast, scalable, and reliable system for processing and managing news data. With its non-blocking, event-driven architecture and extensive package ecosystem, Node.js makes it easy to implement complex features, such as real-time data processing and API integration.

For an optimal data source, utilizing a news API would be preferable. However, for this specific project, data can be obtained from the Hugging Face website at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_news).

> Hugging Face is a popular platform for natural language processing (NLP) models and datasets

**Multi-News**, is a dataset on Hugging Face consists of news articles and human-written summaries of these articles from the site newser.com. Each summary is professionally written by editors and includes links to the original articles cited.

With Node.js is easy to consume this data using native `fetch` function:

```js
async function fetchMultiNews() {
  const url =
    "https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset=multi_news";

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log("Dataset splits data:", data);
      return data;
    } else {
      console.error("Error fetching dataset splits:", response.statusText);
      return response.statusText;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    throw new Error(error);
  }
}

export { fetchMultiNews };
```
