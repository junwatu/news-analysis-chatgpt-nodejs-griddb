# How to Leverage OpenAI, Node.js, and GridDB for Powerful News Topic Modelling

News topic modelling is an essential technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning that focuses on automatically identifying, extracting, and categorizing the main topics or themes present in a collection of news articles. By leveraging advanced algorithms and NLP techniques, such as the powerful GPT-3.5 model developed by OpenAI, news topic modelling can effectively analyze and summarize vast amounts of text data in real-time.

In this blog we will build automated content tagging system. News topic modelling can streamline the content tagging process by automatically assigning appropriate tags or categories to news based on their extracted topics.
